    Setup

    You will be using our demo casino: https://demo.ft-crm.com/ (pw: demo123)

    Background

    We have a small demo casino that we need to have automated tested so it’s working correctly.
    For this test, we expect an automated UI/Browser test suite (ex. selenium, Cyprus etc.).

         ● Make sure we can register on the casino
         ● Make sure we can log in with an existing user
         ● Make sure we can deposit and check so the balance matches.
         ● Make sure that we can play a game and the balance updates.
         ● Make sure we can buy a lottery ticket and the balance is updated.

         ● If you find more cases you want to test feel free to add those to the test suite as well.

    Delivery

    We are expecting a zip file or Github repository with a README on how to run the automated tests.
    We also expect the code to be readable; if complex, there should be comments explaining
    it.
